# Brand Artwork

Butterfly and Ubuntu Butterfly brand artwork.

## Colour palette 🎨

We will be using the colour palette provided by the [Yaru theme](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru),
with the addition of the Butterfly accent colour: `#ff135b`

**This striking pink is called [Awesome](https://www.color-name.com/hex/ff135b)**

## Placeholder logos

Currently we only have placeholder logos made by developers 😱

 - [butterfly/placeholder](butterfly/placeholder)
 - [ubuntu-butterfly/placeholder](ubuntu-butterfly/placeholder)

## Help! 🛟

These logos are temporary placeholders, if you have art 🖌 and design 📐 skills
we'd ***really*** appreciate your contributions to this project.
